Tron Light Cycle Simulator for Entelect Challenge

ToDo List
=========
1) Make it possible to start using external programs based on start.bat principle described in the challenge
2) Adjust visualization and rule checks to account for pole (y=0, y=29) behaviour
3) Lots and lots of testing

What is working
============
I pretty much have the visualization, game.state generation for each player's turn, and "Game Over" detection done and working. Currently the simulator has a built-in "Random move" AI that I used for testing, but no way to use external programs.
