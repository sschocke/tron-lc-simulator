Tron Light Cycle Simulator for Entelect Challenge

ChangeLog
=========
24/07/2012: - Added code for checking, visualizing and handling unique pole (y=0, y=29) behaviour.
28/07/2012: - Added code for executing external start.bat type bots.

ToDo List
=========
1) Lots and lots of testing

What is working
============
I pretty much have the visualization, game.state generation for each player's turn, and "Game Over" detection done and working. Currently the simulator has a built-in "Random move" AI that I used for testing. Also have start.bat type bots supported.
